# ASP_Python_Flask_Demo

This is a quick demonstration that I did when providing a quick training on ML and how the data can be passed and received between the ASP.NET client-server and the Python Flask server. As this is just a demonstration, the version uploaded here is relatively simple.

There are two models used for demonstration here:

Random Forest Classification - deployed on Heroku
Random Forest Regression - deployed on Heroku

You may also notice I have included a text processing demonstration here as well which has not be deployed and is pretty much still a work in progress.

ASP.NET source code used for demonstration has been uploaded to a separate repository here: <a href="https://github.com/lmheng/ASP_Python_Demo_Server">link</a>
